v1.0, 2013-July-11  -- no modifications (MCK)
V1.1, 2013-July-22 
                    -- Fixed minor bugs on names input, and .pz inputs (when p(z) is full of zeros)
                    -- Added weigths options --w1 and --w2 to compute weighted metrics and N(z) (MCK)
V1.1, 2013-July-26  -- Fixed bug on outputs (Nin) and npoisson (MCK)
V1.1, 2013-July-29  -- Fixed bug on errors, Added mask when missing objects on test files and weights are used (MCK)
V1.2, 2013-July-30  -- Added flag to select a fraction frac of galaxies with smallest errors (MCK)
V1.3, 2013-July-31  
                    -- Fixed bug on bias_norm and sigma_norm metrics 
                    -- Added KS statistic for N(z) as output metric 
                    -- Added a fast version of code to compute metrics called plot_des_results_fast.py,
                    -- it runs similar to the original but with no second file option, no plots, just metrics (MCK)
