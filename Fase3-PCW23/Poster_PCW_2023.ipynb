    "In this project, we use the DP0.2 dataset and the DESC's RAIL pipelines to model the total duration of computing photometric redshifts (photo-z) at LIneA's computer cluster Apollo as a function of a list of variables such as (i) the kind of storage hardware used, (ii) the core algorithm adopted, (iii) the file formats for input and output data, and (iv) the output data compression (photo-z PDF representation). We perform stress tests in these different scenarios to verify if the total runtime scales linearly with the size of the dataset and to identify bottlenecks, sources of slowness, and opportunities for workflow optimization in preparation for LSST DR1.

    "Observational astronomy is a vast field encompassing various areas such as the study of the solar system, stellar astrophysics, galaxy structure, extragalactic astrophysics, and cosmology. Measuring distances on cosmological scales, a crucial parameter for numerous research domains, is done indirectly using techniques like galaxy photometry or spectroscopy. Being redshift is a fundamental measure in astronomy that allows determining the distances and ages of celestial objects, such as distant galaxies, identification of objects in large datasets for astronomical surveys, and studies of cosmic evolution. In this context, computer science emerges as a pivotal enabler of progress and advancement in the photo-z area of astronomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer science plays a vital role in the analysis and interpretation of the massive astronomical datasets generated by modern surveys and observations. By employing sophisticated data processing algorithms, machine learning techniques, and high-performance computing methods, computer science contributes significantly to the efficient and accurate determination of redshifts in astronomical objects. The seamless integration of computer science and astronomy enables researchers to explore vast datasets, identify intricate patterns, and derive valuable insights into the structure and evolution of the Universe. This interdependence ensures the synergistic growth of both disciplines, enhancing the overall understanding of celestial phenomena and enriching the scientific pursuit of knowledge.\n",

    "Many of the LSST science cases will rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z) computed for the whole LSST Objects Catalog. As part of LIneA's involvement in the LSST in-kind contribution is the responsibility to provide annual photo-z tables annually  for data releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photo-z production pipeline under development consists in using machine learning algorithms as blackboxes plugged into a big data workflow. The student is participating in a local project with mentorship of an astronomer and a software engineer to investigate strategies to speed-up the photo-z computing process by identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for code optimization, using simulated data (LSST DP0.2) downloaded to the Brazilian IDAC for scalability tests.  \n",
